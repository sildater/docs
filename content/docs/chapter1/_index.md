A match file is distinguished in three main parts. The first part at the beginning of the file contains meta-information such as versioning, names and tags, and score related information, i.e., key signature, time signature, etc. The second part is the main core of the document and contains note-wise alignments, as well as deletions and insertions entries. The third and last part is found at the end of the document and contains all listed sustain pedal events with their MIDI cc values.
